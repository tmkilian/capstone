    "In this project I hope to analyze and target the housing (rental?) prices for San Francisco (and maybe another city). Instead of simply using housing prices, whether asking/sale prices or posted rental rates, I will try to incorporate the wealth of other information from neighborhoods to factor in a more intelligent pricing scheme. In other words, given a price you can afford, where can you get the best deal. This will try to take into account the specific desires of the buyer/renter specific to regions; i.e. is there a higher preference for living near good food, parks, bars, public transit stops, et cetera?\n",
